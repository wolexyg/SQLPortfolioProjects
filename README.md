# Project 1-Population_census.sql

Here is an SQL Data Analysis of the Indian Population census 2011 using Microsoft SQL Server.This data is gotten from www.census2011.co.in/district.php              
Different Data Analysis were performed ranging from;         
1.-Average growth for entire population            
2-total Population of India             
3-Average sex ratio by state              
4-State with the highest growth rate              
5-Average literacy ratio by state            
6-Current total population to previous total population           
7-Top 3 states which have displayed the highest average growth rate.                 


This dataset was created to explore the Data Analysis of the 2011 Population Census of India using different SQL Functions

# Project 2-RFM Analysis on Sales Data Sample

Analysis on sales revenue and customer segmentation analysis using RFM in Microsoft SQL Server with Sales sample data originally downloaded from Kaggle.com
RFM means Recency,Frequency and Monetary.Highlights of the analysis includes amongst others Data Cleaning,RFM Analysis,Using CASE Statements,Window functions,Group by,order by and Having clause functions.The major Data analysis explored on the dataset include;             
1.-Grouping sales by productline             
2.--SALES ACROSS THE YEAR                    
3. REASONS WHY THERE WERE LOW SALES IN 2005            
4.-FINDING THE BEST MONTH FOR SALES IN A PARTICULAR YEAR             
5 -The product generated the highest sales in November        
6--The  best customer using RFM Analysis            
7.The products that are most often sold together           
8.Retrieving the productcode for the orders


This dataset was created to explore the SQL Data Analysis of Sales Sample Data downloaded from www.kaggle.com using RFM Analysis

# Project 3-Cleaning and Exploring SBA Data
# Overview
Here is an SQL Data Analysis of the USA Small Business Administration(SBA).As part of their Covid-19 relief assistance to small businesses,they offered a paycheck
protection program which is a loan they gave out to small businesses to help them pay their workforce.They made some datasets available related to that program which can be downloaded from www.data.sba.gov/dataset/   I will be cleaning and exploring the data to derive meaningful insight in Microsoft
SQL Server.

Project 5-Walmart Data Analysis: End-to-End SQL + Python Project 
Project Overview
Project Pipeline

This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions. The project is ideal for data analysts looking to develop skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and data pipeline creation.

Project Steps
1. Set Up the Environment
Tools Used: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python, SQL (MySQL and PostgreSQL)
Goal: Create a structured workspace within VS Code and organize project folders for smooth development and data handling.
2. Set Up Kaggle API
API Setup: Obtain your Kaggle API token from Kaggle by navigating to your profile settings and downloading the JSON file.
Configure Kaggle:
Place the downloaded kaggle.json file in your local .kaggle folder.
Use the command kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path> to pull datasets directly into your project.
3. Download Walmart Sales Data
Data Source: Use the Kaggle API to download the Walmart sales datasets from Kaggle.
Dataset Link: Walmart Sales Dataset
Storage: Save the data in the data/ folder for easy reference and access.
4. Install Required Libraries and Load Data
Libraries: Install necessary Python libraries using:
pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python psycopg2
Loading Data: Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis and transformations.
5. Explore the Data
Goal: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
Analysis: Use functions like .info(), .describe(), and .head() to get a quick overview of the data structure and statistics.
6. Data Cleaning
Remove Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
Handle Missing Values: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
Fix Data Types: Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as datetime, prices as float).
Currency Formatting: Use .replace() to handle and format currency values for analysis.
Validation: Check for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.
7. Feature Engineering
Create New Columns: Calculate the Total Amount for each transaction by multiplying unit_price by quantity and adding this as a new column.
Enhance Dataset: Adding this calculated field will streamline further SQL analysis and aggregation tasks.
8. Load Data into MySQL and PostgreSQL
Set Up Connections: Connect to MySQL and PostgreSQL using sqlalchemy and load the cleaned data into each database.
Table Creation: Set up tables in both MySQL and PostgreSQL using Python SQLAlchemy to automate table creation and data insertion.
Verification: Run initial SQL queries to confirm that the data has been loaded accurately.
9. SQL Analysis: Complex Queries and Business Problem Solving
Business Problem-Solving: Write and execute complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:
Revenue trends across branches and categories.
Identifying best-selling product categories.
Sales performance by time, city, and payment method.
Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.
Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
Documentation: Keep clear notes of each query's objective, approach, and results.
10. Project Publishing and Documentation
Documentation: Maintain well-structured documentation of the entire process in Markdown or a Jupyter Notebook.
Project Publishing: Publish the completed project on GitHub or any other version control platform, including:
The README.md file (this document).
Jupyter Notebooks (if applicable).
SQL query scripts.
Data files (if possible) or steps to access them.
Requirements
Python 3.8+
SQL Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL
Python Libraries:
pandas, numpy, sqlalchemy, mysql-connector-python, psycopg2
Kaggle API Key (for data downloading)
