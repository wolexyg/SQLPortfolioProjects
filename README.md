# Project 2-RFM Analysis on Sales Data Sample

Analysis on sales revenue and customer segmentation analysis using RFM in Microsoft SQL Server with Sales sample data originally downloaded from Kaggle.com
RFM means Recency,Frequency and Monetary.Highlights of the analysis includes amongst others Data Cleaning,RFM Analysis,Using CASE Statements,Window functions,Group by,order by and Having clause functions.The major Data analysis explored on the dataset include;             
1.-Grouping sales by productline             
2.--SALES ACROSS THE YEAR

# Project 3-Cleaning and Exploring SBA Data
# Overview
Here is an SQL Data Analysis of the USA Small Business Administration(SBA).As part of their Covid-19 relief assistance to small businesses,they offered a paycheck
protection program which is a loan they gave out to small businesses to help them pay their workforce.They made some datasets available related to that program which can be downloaded from www.data.sba.gov/dataset/   I will be cleaning and exploring the data to derive meaningful insight in Microsoft
SQL Server.

## Analysis Flow:
1. Product Analysis
Analyzed product line performance to identify top contributors to revenue and profit, while highlighting areas for strategic improvement.

2. Sales Analysis
Evaluated sales trends across time, branches, and payment channels to assess the effectiveness of sales strategies and uncover opportunities for revenue growth.

3. Customer Analysis
Segmented customers to understand buying behavior, analyze revenue contribution by segment, and uncover actionable insights to optimize customer engagement and profitability.

## Approach Used
1. Data Wrangling

During this initial phase, the data is examined to detect any NULL or missing values, and strategies for data replacement are implemented to address and substitute these values effectively.

## Build a database
Create a table and insert the data.
Select columns with null values in them. Null values are not present in our database because, in creating the tables, NOT NULL was specified for each field, effectively filtering out any null values.             
## 2. Feature Engineering               

## Derived new columns from existing data for time-based analysis:

time_of_day: Categorized transactions into Morning, Afternoon, and Evening to analyze peak sales periods during the day.

day_name: Extracted weekday names to identify branch activity trends across the week.

month_name: Extracted month names to evaluate monthly sales and profitability performance.            

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-- Which time of the day do customers give most ratings?
-- Which time of the day do customers give most ratings per branch?
-- Which day of the week has the best avg ratings?
-- Which day of the week has the best average ratings per branch?
# Advanced Analytics
-- Is there a correlation between high ratings and higher gross income?
-- Which product line is most sensitive to time_of_day (i.e. shows the most variation in sales across different times)?
-- Which branch has the fastest-moving inventory (highest quantity sold relative to number of invoices)?
## Month-over-Month Revenue Growth
-- Which product line shows the most variation in sales across different times of the day?
